Content: "The Cortisol Awakening Response:

When we wake up, our body experiences a natural increase in cortisol levels, known as the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Cortisol is a stress hormone that helps us feel alert and awake. Consuming caffeine during this cortisol spike can diminish the effects of both cortisol and caffeine, making your morning coffee less effective in boosting your energy levels.

Caffeine and Adenosine Receptors:

Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that promotes sleepiness, and its levels increase throughout the day. By waiting 90 minutes after waking to consume caffeine, you allow your adenosine levels to rise slightly, making the caffeine more effective at blocking the receptors and keeping you alert."

I know a lot of people who refuse to take them for that reason. I can tell you from experience I don't do art anymore however... I 100% feel that my life is better on medicine after I found what works for me. All these misdiagnosis are an issue 😅 the side effects from bipolar meds are sometimes really bad so if you took some I feel for you.

Content: Haha yea I remember those days. I worked with a bank for like 5 years.
It was pretty chill and after a while I felt stagnant, like I could see a path higher there but it wasn't appealing

Content: I had switched bc of the job security. It definitely has paid off in employment to be in the field bc I've been in multiple industries but the schooling doesn't really match real life.

An IT degree? That's awesome!
I am burnout on school right now tbh but I have six classes left so I'm coping. If I wasn't working full time I wouldve finished a while ago but I'll get it done 😅

What are you currently studying that's interesting?

Content: Hey I just added u. Plz check. I agree that certain major degrees aren't necessary at all. Let's say my field, fashion design. Associates is more than enough, having job experiences, a solid portfolio and networking are the key. So I guess it really depends on the majors lol

Content: I just started looking into it a lil bit about a week ago. The basic idea from what I know so far is that they are an advanced civilization that come from a distant planet called nibiru (I think) which comes into our orbit once every 3000 years or something. So these aliens/gods came to earth cause their planet was deteriorating and they needed an element to help restore their planet which was gold. Apparently they came to earth with their own slaves (a different species called igigi) to mine gold. Couple centuries later these slaves tried to fight back and almost got completely wiped out by the annunaki cause of the overwhelming difference in power. Then because they had no slaves they essentially created human to be their new slaves
